                    Order of Ontario (1996) Website chrishadfield.ca Chris Austin Hadfield OC OOnt MSC CD (born August 29,
                    1959) is a Canadian retired astronaut, engineer, and former Royal Canadian Air Force fighter pilot. The
                    first Canadian to walk in space, Hadfield has flown two space shuttle missions and served as commander
                    of the International Space Station. Hadfield, who was raised on a farm in southern Ontario, was inspired
                    as a child when he watched the Apollo 11 Moon landing on TV. He attended high school in Oakville and
                    Milton and earned his glider pilot licence as a member of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets. He joined the
                    Canadian Armed Forces and earned an engineering degree at Royal Military College. While in the military
                    he learned to fly various types of aircraft and eventually became a test pilot and flew several experimental
                    planes. As part of an exchange program with the United States Navy and United States Air Force, he obtained
                    a master's degree in aviation systems at the University of Tennessee Space Institute. In 1992, he was
                    accepted into the Canadian astronaut program by the Canadian Space Agency. He first flew in space aboard
                    STS-74 in November 1995 as a mission specialist. During the mission he visited the Russian space station
                    Mir. In April 2001 he flew again on STS-100 and visited the International Space Station (ISS), where
                    he walked in space and helped to install the Canadarm2. In December 2012 he flew for a third time aboard
                    Soyuz TMA-07M and joined Expedition 34 on the ISS. He was a member of this expedition until March 2013
                    when he became the commander of the ISS as part of Expedition 35. He was responsible for a crew of five
                    astronauts and helped to run dozens of scientific experiments dealing with the impact of low gravity
                    on human biology. During the mission, he also gained popularity by chronicling life aboard the space
                    station and taking pictures of the Earth and posting them on various social media platforms to a large
                    following of people around the world. He was a guest on television news and talk shows and gained popularity
                    by playing the International Space Station's guitar in space. His mission ended in May 2013 when he returned
                    to Earth. Shortly after returning, he announced his retirement, capping a 35-year career as a military
                    pilot and an astronaut.</li>
